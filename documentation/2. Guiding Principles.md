# Guiding principles

The IDSA Rulebook is based on a set of generic principles and underlying
values. The key aspects are related to the governance of data spaces and
the roles actors can have.

**Not reinventing the wheel:** use proven technologies

**Integrate existing systems:** integrate data spaces into existing
systems to the extent possible

**Integrate or use existing standards**: align national and
international specifications, technical standards, and established
processes

**Industry and domain independent**: make data spaces applicable as a
concept as a horizontal standard

**Easy to use**: low deployment threshold for companies and initiatives
with a focus on portability and replicability

IDSA applies four key governance principles: accountability,
transparency, fairness, and responsibility. As a result, IDSA offers
free use of IDS specifications and related open resources for all, open
governance processes in which everyone can participate, transparent
decision making - preferably by consensus.
