# Legal dimension

This section of the Rulebook gives an overview of the regulatory framework and describes IDSA's approach of compliance with regulatory requirements and contractual agreements.

## 6.1 Regulatory framework

The lack of a general legal status (access regime) for data, partial
application of IP rights and trade secret protection and the
restrictions of personal data protection result in a fragmented and
incomplete regulatory framework. To address these shortcomings in data
sharing and reuse, the EU Commission presented the "[European strategy
for data](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy-data)" in February 2020 describing the vision of a common European
data space. The Commission has proposed different regulations ([Digital Markets Act (DMA)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A842%3AFIN), [Digital Services Act (DSA)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0825), [AI Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206) on
harmonised rules for data governance, data access and use as part of the
[EU's digital strategy](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy-data).

Beside other regulations the [Data Governance Act (DGA)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R0868)
entered into force on 23 June 2022 and will be applicable from September
2023 after a 15-months grace period. On 23 February 2022, the Commission
proposed a regulation on harmonised rules for fair access and use of
data, the [Data Act Proposal (DA-E)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A68%3AFIN).
With both acts the Commission aims to make more data available for use,
by setting up rules on who can use and access what data for which
purposes across all economic sectors in the EU.

The [DGA](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act-explained) aims to make more data available by regulating the reuse of
publicly/held, protected data, by promoting data sharing through the
regulation of novel data intermediaries and by encouraging the sharing
of data for altruistic purposes.
It aims to make public sector data more widely available for local
businesses, researchers and communities for the development of
innovative data-driven services. A specific focus is on the public
sector data which is subject to legal restrictions and thus out of the
scope of the Open Data Directive. Therefore, the proposal
covers public sector data which is legally protected on the grounds of:
(a) commercial confidentiality including the trade secrets; (b)
statistical confidentiality; (c) intellectual property rights of third
parties; (d) protection of personal data. This objective of providing
access to data that is not accessible as open data may be seen as
indicative of the emergence of a distinct regime for the data held by
public bodies. The public sector bodies enabling the use of such
protected data are required to be technically equipped to ensure that
data privacy and confidentiality are fully preserved. The proposal does
not interfere with the substantive rights on data as it refrains from
prescribing a right of access or reuse but lays out certain harmonized
rules and conditions guiding member states for establishing mechanisms
for the reuse of publicly held data.

The [DA-E](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1113) aims to ensure fairness in the digital environment, stimulate a
competitive data market, open opportunities for data-driven innovation
and make data more accessible for all by providing consumers and
businesses access to the data of their
devices.
The DA-E is regarded to be an essential building block of the European
data spaces. It is guided by the understanding that B2B contractual
agreements do not fully guarantee adequate access to data for SMEs or
start-ups. A contractual framework is needed, providing clarity on
rights and remedies regarding accessing, processing, sharing, and
storing of data in order to limit misuse. The proposal acknowledges the
importance of a harmonised data governance regime in achieving
competitiveness, innovation and sustainable growth in all sectors and
making the Union's transition to a green digital economy a success. The
proposal introduces interventions to the current legal landscape of B2B
data sharing and access in two dimensions: first, contracts as voluntary
agreements and second, statutory access rights or obligations to make
data available together with the general rules to be complied while
performing these obligations or exercising the rights.

Beside these specific Acts, further legal aspects to consider when
sharing data, including antitrust/competition, data protection and
security, copyright, patents/Intellectual property. The regulatory
development may have more impact on the concept and operationalization
of data spaces in the future and needs to be monitored to ensure
compliance.

The operationalisation of data governance and the establishment of data
spaces require a robust methodology both to navigate through the
existing regulatory patchwork (scattered in various legal instruments)
and to implement the upcoming legislative agenda of the EU*.* Providing
guidance to future-proof specific problems entails an assessment and
combination of various regulatory tools, contractual models, design
principles, and organizational structures. To this end, the below
***four-pillar data governance framework*** outlines a "legal anatomy"
of data governance consisting of the following:

1. the substantive rights and obligations related to data transactions
    (rights to data)
2. the contractual dimension
3. the organizational aspects
4. the technical implementation.

Beside the own responsibility of participants in a decentralized
organization, IDSA discusses and aligns on legal matters with other
initiatives. Coordination with other initiatives on the legal dimension
is all the more important as often (and by its nature) most legislation
needs to be translated into practical approaches and solutions - and a
common understanding of the legal terms is necessary to create a
trustworthy and reliable EU data sharing landscape.

Therefore, IDSA has established a legal framework task force to discuss
regulatory developments and legal topics as well as to organize the
collaboration and contribution of IDSA members regarding the legal
dimension.

## 6.2 Legal Agreements & SITRA Rulebook

The analysis of the relevant legal frameworks pertaining to data
transactions reveals that there are many gaps and overlaps in the
current legal landscape mostly because, i) significant parts of the data
do not have a standard legal status as intangible assets, and ii) these
legal regimes do not address the needs of the data economy or the
specificities of data transactions.

As legislation only provides the general framework for data sharing, the
legal dimension of a data space includes a contractual framework so that
the different participants can agree on specified rules that fit their
data sharing context. In a decentralized organization where participants
are free to choose their contract partner and freely agree on contract
terms, the contractual framework means a suggested model of terms that
can be amended according to the needs (template approach).

Considering IDSA's focus on other dimensions and the importance of
alliance with other initiatives, IDSA takes an "adopting & consolidation
approach" to the contractual framework. Therefore, IDSA did not invent
an own set of legal agreements for IDS participants to be used instead
opting to suggest an already established contractual framework modified
regarding IDS specifics.

SITRA's rulebook for a fair data economy provides tools for networks
where organizations can share data and create services. The rulebook
model includes contractual templates and tools for building a data
sharing network. It sets out legal, business, technical, security, and
administrative rules as well as ethical guidelines to be observed by
organizations in data sharing networks. The rulebook model consists,
among other things, of contractual templates, a set of control questions
and a draft code of conduct that can be used to create a customized
rulebook for a data network. Sitra published the first version of the
rulebook for a fair data economy in 2020 and has updated it several
times since. The rulebook model is backed by Sitra's longterm work on
the fair data economy and a large group of experts from companies and
other organizations who have made valuable contributions to the rulebook
model.

The basic principles of the [Sitra rulebook](https://www.sitra.fi/en/publications/rulebook-for-a-fair-data-economy/) align well with the goals of
this IDSA Rulebook:

**Sovereignty**

IDS has made sovereignty of the data owner its most important design
principle. In the Rulebook data provider has sovereignty over its
data. The instrument for the data provider to exercise its sovereignty
is through the data terms of use, in which the data provider can
decide to whom it grants access and under what conditions it releases
the data for use by others in the data network.
**Trust**
Enabling trust is the first of the foundational IDS concepts. Trust is
encompassed in the Sitra Rulebook primarily through the balance
between the sovereign data providers and data users building new
business with the data. For instance, seizing the provision of data is
allowed, the termination period can be set to fit the needs of the
business or even initial fixed terms can be agreed upon. By default,
the data already distributed may still be used by the data user after
termination, but the provision of new data is seized. The balance is
also found in the clauses defining the boundary between data and
derived material in a way that it fits the context and needs of the
data provider and the data user. The Sitra rulebook also includes
clauses on auditing and extensive tools for ensuring that data
security and ethical principles are taken into account in the design
of data networks.

Considering the IDS dimensions, the SITRA templates are a valuable basis
to create the contract framework for data sharing based on IDS
principles and specifications. IDSA follows a "narrow" approach
regarding the suggested contract templates as the idea is to provide a
general framework that should be amended according to the specific
needs.

## 6.3 Contract templates for IDS

Based on the SITRA templates IDSA will start drafting additional
components for contract templates for IDS (that will be published after
this Rulebook). Such templates will be attached to this Rulebook and
regularly updated reflecting new developments.

The IDS contract framework will not duplicate all components of the
SITRA rulebook. The full set of SITRA rulebook templates are intended to
be used in the creation and set-up of a data space, including governance
models of the data ecosystem. These may not be necessary for the
purposes of the IDSA Rulebook. Therefore, the IDS contract framework
will focus on additional components and guidance highlighted in
different use cases of data sharing implemented under the IDS
specifications. These may include domain-specific dataset terms of use
templates or more detailed components for cross-continent data sharing
or privacy. If the IDS contract framework requires modifications to the
SITRA rulebook's terms and conditions, they will be proposed also to
Sitra's workgroup to maintain compatibility and to avoid different
versions of terms and conditions.
