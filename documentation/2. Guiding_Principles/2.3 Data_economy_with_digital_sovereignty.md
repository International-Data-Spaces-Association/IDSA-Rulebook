## Data economy with digital sovereignty

Using IDS based frameworks, services and offerings guarantees data
sovereignty for your business.

There are some common rules and guidelines:

* Common definition on lifecycle agreements for IDS-based assets, the
IDS standards and services. See appendix "Operational Agreements, Life
Cycle".

* General definitions of necessary processes for development,
certification, onboarding, operation and usage. See appendix
"Operational agreements. Processes".

Typical roles of an IDS based data space are described in more detail in
a following chapter. Some papers will also address the different roles
with examples of use cases and business models.

In summary, using IDS with its data sovereignty is a competitive
advantage for your own business and quite easy to do, since everything
is well prepared. The [IDSA website provides](https://www.internationaldataspaces.org) all information. A hotline can help with
questions (SupportOffice@internationaldatspaces.org).
