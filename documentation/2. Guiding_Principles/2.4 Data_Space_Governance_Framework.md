## Data Space Governance Framework

The Data Space Governance Framework is the defined set of technical policies, 
business rules, and regulations that participants in a data space have to adhere to. It is the core
agreement between all parties, which defines a data space. The Data Space Governance 
Authority is mandated to maintain and enforce the Data Space Governance Framework.

The [functional requirements](../3.%20Functional_Requirements/3.3%20Establishing_trust.md#policies)section explains how such a framework needs to be translated into
a common set of policies.
