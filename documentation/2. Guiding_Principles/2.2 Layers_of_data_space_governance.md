## Layers of data space governance

The layers of data space governance (Figure 4) are inspired by the
Design Principles for Data Spaces[^7] publication. This was developed in
the context of the OPEN DEI project funded by EU where data spaces
experts teamed up to define cross-sectoral principles for building data
spaces.

| **Layer​**      |  **Description​**                                        |
|:-------------  | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data space instance governance** |  Executes and implements the governance practices and rules of a data space instance. Oversees data space functions and the rules.​|
|  **Data space ecosystem governance​** | Defines the rules for the data space instance. Creates the intra data space trust between collaborating organizations. Complements standardization and regulation focusing on business-driven rules. Defines the inter data space interoperability practices.​ |
| **Data space domain governance​**  | Establishes sector-specific data space principles and mechanisms including semantic interoperability and domain-specific regulation. Leaves room for geographical differences while supporting maximum interoperability.​ |
|**Soft infrastructure governance​**| Brings all the generic data space building blocks and concepts together, defines the legal basis and creates the common framework on which all data spaces are built.​|
