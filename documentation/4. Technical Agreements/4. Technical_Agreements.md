# Technical agreements

This section of the Rulebook describes the technical arrangements
required to implement an IDS-based data room. The IDS Rulebook specifies
what is mandatory and what is optional to implement but keep some
freedom how to realize these concepts (see also the section on the goals
of IDS in the IDS RAM).

The technical agreements of the
IDS-framework consist of the Reference Architecture Model (RAM) that
provides a technology-independent perspective and the
technology-specific specification on IDS-G. The two provide guidance to
create the required components. The certification scheme including the
certification criteria and the IDS-testbed helps validate compliance
with the RAM and the specification. This is IDSA's so-called magic
triangle, which is extended with the portfolio of open-source building
blocks, such as commercial solutions that are certified but not
mandatorily available as FOSS. The Rulebook itself provides a frame for
the magic triangle by describing the overarching concept of data spaces.

The mentioned IDSA assets have a defined release time to ensure
consistency between them. In general, an IDS asset can be released after
approval by the IDSA working groups and final approval by the technical
steering committee. To achieve reliability for industrial use of the IDS
assets, major releases that contain fundamental changes may be conducted
once per year. For more details see the table below.

| Asset | Major releases | Approving body |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| IDS-RAM  | Second quarter of a year |    Working group architecture |
| IDS-G specifications  |  Fourth quarter of a year |    Working group architecture |
| Certification scheme  |  Second quarter of a year |    Working group certification |
| IDS-reference testbed  | Fourth quarter of a year |     Working group certification |
| IDSA Rulebook |  Third quarter of a year | Working group Rulebook |
