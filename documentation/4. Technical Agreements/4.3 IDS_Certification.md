## IDS Certification

The IDS Certification is a perspective in the IDS-RAM and its approach
is described in detail in the IDS Certification scheme (general
structure, operational structure, and maintenance of the certification
criteria).

- The [certification scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0/tree/main/documentation/4_Perspectives_of_the_Reference_Architecture_Model/4_2_Certification_Perspective/CertificationScheme) describes the operational model and
    roles in the IDS Certification.

- The [rules of procedure](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0/tree/main/documentation/4_Perspectives_of_the_Reference_Architecture_Model/4_2_Certification_Perspective/RulesOfProcedure) include the formal outline of
    organizational processes

- [Approval of evaluators](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0/tree/main/documentation/4_Perspectives_of_the_Reference_Architecture_Model/4_2_Certification_Perspective/ApprovalScheme)

- Execution of evaluations

- The [certification criteria](https://internationaldataspaces.org/publications/white-papers/) list the formal aspects of
    evaluations for the core components and the operational environment.

While the certification scheme and the documents listed above describe
the formal aspects of IDS Certifications, the IDS testbed provides the
tools and technological basis for evaluating the IDS core components.
