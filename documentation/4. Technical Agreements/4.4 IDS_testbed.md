## IDS testbed (interoperability test)

Evaluation facilities for components conduct the evaluations that ensure
a correct implementation of the IDS specifications and an adequate level
of security in the components. Ensuring a comparable quality of all
evaluations is necessary to make the certification reliable with its
different security and assurance levels.

This includes:

- All evaluation facilities conduct transparent conformance tests in
    the [â€žIDS reference testbed"](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed) based on the regulations from the
    certification working group and approved by the IDSA technical
    steering committee.

- All evaluation facilities assess compliance with the security
    requirements listed in the IDS criteria catalog based on tests
    derived from the criteria. Tests that can be conducted automatically
    are part of the [test suite](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed/tree/master/Testsuite) of the IDS-testbed.

- The evaluation facilities issue a certificate when conformance and
    security tests are passed.

- To ensure that the evaluation facilities conduct the evaluations
    according to the specifications, the certification body must assess
    their competence.

Ensuring interoperability between the components is one important aspect
of the evaluation and covered by the test suite provided.
