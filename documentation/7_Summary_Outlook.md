# Summary and outlook

This IDSA rulebook version 2 recognizes the growing need for structural
approaches to accessing and sharing data while maintaining data
sovereignty. The use of guiding principles helps identify solutions for
this growing market. It includes the understanding of the current
European regulation and legislation but does not stop there as data
spaces are meant to be international.

The functional analysis of both parts, the creation of a data space and
the data space authority, as well as the requirements and obligations of
a participant in a data space is a central piece of this document. The
comprehensive outline provides guidance for the creation of data spaces.
This is complemented by the governance view on the rights and
obligations for data spaces as a whole and the data space instances.

The analysis of the legal framework for data spaces is ongoing and
subject to continuous debate and will be part of this rulebook in future
versions.

IDSA and its partners are supported by the Data Spaces Support Centre
(DSSC) which will offer additional guidance.

Based on the recent IDSA work, additional publications provide more
insights into data spaces. The data space landscape reports on technical
and semantic interoperability and will be part of future rulebooks. The
relationship between the different stakeholders in the data space
landscape and how they form a comprehensive framework will be further
investigated.
