## 6.3 Contract templates for IDS

Based on the SITRA templates IDSA will start drafting additional
components for contract templates for IDS (that will be published after
this Rulebook). Such templates will be attached to this Rulebook and
regularly updated reflecting new developments.

The IDS contract framework will not duplicate all components of the
SITRA rulebook. The full set of SITRA rulebook templates are intended to
be used in the creation and set-up of a data space, including governance
models of the data ecosystem. These may not be necessary for the
purposes of the IDSA Rulebook. Therefore, the IDS contract framework
will focus on additional components and guidance highlighted in
different use cases of data sharing implemented under the IDS
specifications. These may include domain-specific dataset terms of use
templates or more detailed components for cross-continent data sharing
or privacy. If the IDS contract framework requires modifications to the
SITRA rulebook's terms and conditions, they will be proposed also to
Sitra's workgroup to maintain compatibility and to avoid different
versions of terms and conditions.
