## [Version 2.0](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDSA-Rulebook/releases/tag/Rulebook_V2)
---

### Added

* Section 2 on Guiding Principles is new to the IDSA Rulebook with the scope to explain the context of the authors and contributors of the IDSA Rulebook without being normative.
While the general guiding principles of IDSA remain unchanged, the section provides overarching considerations for data spaces by analyzing political, economic, social, technical, legal and environmental aspects considered as important from a European perspective. The Guiding Principles section addresses the different Layers of Data Space Governance, distinguishing between Data Space Instances, Ecosystems, domains and soft infrastructure. Aspects of digital sovereignty are addressed, as well as a core role model that can be derrived from the legal framweork described in this section.
* Section 3 on Functional Requirements covers now an in depth analysis of functional requirements for data spaces. The analysis covers a description of the foundational concepts and the technical component to be realized. As the concepts can build on and the technical componets can realize their fucntionality on centralized, decentralized or federated strucures, the Functional Requirements section provides some decision support to decide on those topics.
* Section 3 provides a general outline for a generic Role Model and components model for Data Spaces, which currently extendds the perspective of the IDS Reference Architecture Model.
* The Legal Dimension of the IDSA Rulebook covers a desciption of the European Regulatory Framework and the perspective of Legal Agreements in conjunction with the SITRA Rulebook. Contract templates are currently not yet part of this section, as those are still under development.

### Changed

* Introduction updated to align with the remainder of the document
* Summary and Outlook upodated according to the updated content of the IDSA Rulebook
* Technical Agreements are updated according to the current developments in the IDS-RAM, IDS Certification, IDS-G Specifications and the IDS Reference Testbed
* The IDSA Rulebook is now maintained in a Github Repository to focus on the content instead of formatting and enhance the collaboration in the Working Group.
